# Margin Trading Strategies


Mechanics of Margin Trading


The first aspect is the trader's ability to customize the margin trading strategy. A trader will have a wide variety of cryptocurrencies available in their portfolio, so there is a need for a system to allow a trader to customize their margin strategy.

Instead of a single cryptocurrency that can be used for collateral, a trader will have many assets that can be used as collateral. A margin trading strategy should therefore take advantage of the full range of assets available in a trader's portfolio.


Tools for Quantitative Analysis
